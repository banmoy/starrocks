## Why I'm doing:
Fix insert failure when `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT` runs concurrently with INSERT. Example error:

```
W20251126 14:19:42.127170 22869312996928 tablet_sink.cpp:272] type of exprs is not match slot's, expr_type=17, slot_type=5, slot_name=c1
```

## What I'm doing:
- Insert planner: when filling newly added (schema-change) columns, build a `ColumnRefOperator` from the computed default `ScalarOperator` and rely on the existing `castOutputColumnsTypeToTargetColumns` to align final types with target columns. This avoids transient type mismatches during planning.
- Improves stability of concurrent insert + add column with default.

Fixes: #issue

### Notes
- Root cause: default value expression produced a `ScalarOperator` whose immediate type could differ from target column type, leading to mismatch during planning when referencing it directly.
- Solution: create column ref from the default expression and rely on the planner's existing cast step (`castOutputColumnsTypeToTargetColumns`) to reconcile with the target schema.
